AlphaGo is an AI developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary company of Alphabet Inc. AlphaGo took its place in magazines and news in 2016 beating the world's most intelligent Go player, Lee Sedol in a five-game match.

Go is a kind of ancient Chinese board game that has simple rules but is incredibly complex and cannot be played without human intuition. The game has an enormous number of moves to make the game more complex and really hard or just impossible for a machine to learn, as many scientists thought at that time.

But AlphaGo developed a human-level intuition and is able to play the game more creatively than anyone ever played. This is possible by a method of training machine learning models known as Deep Reinforcement Learning. The model is trained over a large corpus of human Go games and fine-tuned using Reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error method).

The victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol was a great moment in the history of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The researchers at DeepMind claim that their AI is general-purpose, meaning that it can do a lot more than just play Go. As a result, engineers used it to regulate the cooling systems in Google data centers and also used to solve other kinds of problems like protein folding, etc.
