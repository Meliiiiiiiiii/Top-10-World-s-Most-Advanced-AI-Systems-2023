Watson is an AI system developed by IBM. It was initially developed as a chatbot that can answer questions, built on top of Advanced Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks. Later, IBM put Watson to the test against humans in America's popular quiz game show named Jeopardy. Interestingly, Watson beat the champions of the game and won a prize worth $1 million.

In recent years, Watson is more capable so IBM engineers use it to build a lot of tools and applications like customer service, chatbots, Virtual Assistants, Recommender Systems, etc. 

Moreover, Watson also performs well in healthcare applications, as it can even predict the possibility of skin cancers by just seeing the image of a person. It is able to detect various kinds of diseases like cancers, cardiovascular disease, heart disease, etc, with greater accuracy and also recommends medication. These abilities of Watson are utilized by a lot of health centers and hospitals all across the world.

With the rise in computational power and resources today, Watson AI has become extremely powerful, capable of performing tasks once limited to humans such as sight, hearing, speech, and learning.
