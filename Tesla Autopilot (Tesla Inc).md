Tesla Inc is one of the leading companies in the electric automobile industry. The company's aim is to build electric vehicles like cars, trucks, etc, with adding technology. Apart from manufacturing electric cars, they are also interested in Artificial Intelligence and incorporating all its possibilities into their vehicles for better driving experiences.

As a result, they developed Tesla Autopilot, which is very popular. Tesla Autopilot is a complex AI system that is able to control the vehicle using cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and GPS. With Autopilot engaged, the vehicle can automatically steer, accelerate, and brake. It can drive, park, and reverse the vehicle entirely by itself by looking at the situations around on the road. Another interesting fact is that this AI can detect accidents with around 90 to 95 % of accuracy, reducing accidents significantly.

Tesla Autopilot uses Advanced AI technologies like Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Sensor Fusion, and Motion Planning, and uses Deep Reinforcement Learning for learning through experience over time. As a matter of fact, Tesla Autopilot is continuously learning and improving its capabilities through reinforcement learning for making good decisions on the road far better than humans.
